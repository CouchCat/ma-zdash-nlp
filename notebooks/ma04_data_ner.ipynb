This allows the creation for enough data for the task in a short amount of time, however, the tradeoff is lower quality, which is somewhat apparent in the performance of the NER, though good enough for the prototype. The general approach employed here are:\n","* Token-based similarity through cosine distance with GloVe vectors (100d) provided by Gensim\n","* Hand-picked words are gathered for specific entity categories and chose based on this similarity value and if it passes a specific threshold\n","* This accounts for\n","  * PROD: products\n","  * BRND: brand names\n","  * MATR: Materials\n","  * TIME: Time\n","  * MISC: Miscellaneous\n","* PERS: person names are difficult to manually gather. In this case, the SpaCy is used to tag this type\n","  * Using SpaCy's medium English module since the large version takes to long to process\n","* The main entities are PROD and BRND while the others are in place in order to better distinguish the tokens\n","  * Problematic cases are person names being classified as brand names, e.g. Tommy Hilfiger\n","  * Other problemtatic cases are product words having high similarity values to words such as 'leather', 'cloth', which is why a seperate entity MATR is in place.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"A3YKYlohVr6c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1613827055080,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2549,"user":{"displayName":"Carlos
